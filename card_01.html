        <h2>The beginning</h2>
        <div class="content-middle">
            <p>
                Apple’s journey began in 1976 with a team of three men those being Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. 
                The companies first product was the Apple I designed by Steve Wozniak. The Apple I was sold as a motherboard 
                only and it had a CPU, RAM and video chip which was the first to be sold that way until then. It was sold at 
                a price of $666, and to fund its production Jobs had to sell his VW Bus and Wozniak his HP-65 calculator.  
                The company was incorporated a year later in Cupertino, California but by then one of its co-founders, Ronald Wayne,
                 had left and sold his shares of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak. The company continued innovating and on 
                 April 1977 released the Apple II, that went on to be the companies first successful product.

        <h2>Macintosh</h2>
        <div class="content-middle">
            <p>
                The early phases of Mac's development started at a time where technological ambition was through the roof. The '80s didn't enjoy seeing a new wave in music, but also in computing, and it all started in 1977 with the Apple II. Although not technically the first of its kind, it was unique and revolutionary enough to be widely considered the very first personal computer to become popular. Not only was the Apple II now at the top of the computing world, but it was also Apple's entry to the big leagues, and it sparked a movement for personal computers as a legitimate, profitable market. Several big companies now wanted in to create the next big personal computer, and not too long after, someone did. In 1981, a company that had only been growing bigger since the end of World War II enters the picture here enters the IBM PC, a machine very easy to use in comparison to everything else that was available. It would become the first PC to dominate the Apple II sales, and it only took them a few months. Apple might have been riding the wave of the Apple II for quite some time, but technology was changing quickly, and this was a wake-up call. <br><br>The Apple II was already four years old, and small upgrades wasn't going to be enough. The company was no longer number one, and they had to act fast before they fell even further. Apple had to innovate once again. The IBM's launch marked a second wave in personal computing. Steve Jobs was determined to create the third industry standard machine. Priority was now placed on a project Apple had been working on for a few years, the Apple Lisa. This was going to be the computer that changed everything, because it surrounded a brilliant concept. What if you could get everything done with just the click of a button? Of course, we are talking about the mouse and the desktop environment, also known as the GUI. Knowing all these sophisticated commands was no longer necessary to operate a computer. You could just click what you want, and type what you want. 
                Jobs wanted to use that with the Lisa so everyday businesses could get tons of work done without having to spend months on learning code and reading manuals. The concept was brilliant, but during its production, it wouldn't take long for business politics to enter the picture.

                <p>
                Jobs was very difficult to work with when creating the Lisa, so much so that he was kicked from the project. Disagreement over how the computer should be designed, and how it should be priced led to a very Game of Thrones maneuver. Steve Jobs would lead his own project and recruit his own employees to help him create the computer he wanted to make, essentially competing with the Lisa on who could make the better machine. Jobs resurrected a dormant Apple project called the Macintosh, a project created in 1979 by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, and employee Jef Raskin. The name came from Raskin's favourite fruit, a Macintosh Apple, and he and Wozniak had the vision of making a computer that was cheap, simple, and aimed at the everyday person. This would be the perfect competitor for the Lisa. The big selling point for the Lisa was its easy-to-use desktop environment, but what if you could make it even easier, so easy that anyone could use it, including your 85-year-old grandmother, a computer that would come with its own games, word processor, graphics editor, other programs provided by Microsoft, and it could even talk to you? Steve Jobs took the boldest marketing risk you could possibly make, and made his target audience everyone, trying to solve everyone's problems, while also solving problems people didn't even know existed yet.
                <br><br>

                <img src="images/macintosh-presentation.png" alt="macintosh-presentation">
                <p>
                The Macintosh was born, and Jobs made it very clear that this would be the third industry standard for computing. – “Today, one year after Lisa, we are introducing the third industry milestone product, Macintosh.” - Completely disregarding the new Commodore 64, which had just become the highest selling computer of all time, with its GUI and mouse, the Macintosh would triumph everything else. Lisa proved to be a giant failure at its launch. With its slow speeds, poor design, and a market price of $10,000, no one wanted to buy it. This only gave Jobs a bigger advantage, because the Macintosh would do everything that Lisa could, but cheaper, and more efficient. People were excited about this new machine. Jobs was so determined on taking down IBM's monopoly that nothing else mattered, including how practical the Macintosh was, and this would be deeply reflected in the product itself. The Mac's launch did anything but exceed expectations. The media was projecting sales that had never been seen before in the history of computers, and at the start, that is what they got. But when the machine finally had an enough time to truly reveal itself, the rose-tinted glasses came off, and things took a sharp turn. With how development went, it's easy to see in hindsight that the Macintosh was none other than a deeply flawed machine. The headstrong leadership from Steve Jobs created a product with an overconfident design, slightly misleading marketing campaign, high cost, and lack of a real-world practical use. 
                <br><br>
                So, in the end the macintosh proved to be a sales failure. It was both ahead of its time, and behind it. But it transmitted its message and Steve’s vision for the future that computers could not be confusing anymore if they wanted to get more powerful. The only way to maximize their capabilities is by maximizing their audience to appeal to all kinds of people who can share all kinds of perspectives, ideas, new information, to be continuously innovative and forward-thinking, to be Macintosh, the computer for the rest of us. And only a few years later proof that the macintosh had made its job was on the release of Windows in 1985.

        <h3>Steve Jobs was fired.</h3>
        <p>
            If you’re asking yourself right now – “how can you be fired from your own company?” 
            Well, and the answer to that is, you make someone else in charge of it. And that was exactly what Steve Jobs did back when he started the Apple. At that time Steve was only a 21-year-old and that made him very sceptical over if he was able to run Apple, and so, to put his fears to rest, businessman Michael Scott joined Apple as their CEO, in 1977.  While not being CEO allowed Steve Jobs to work more on product development on projects like, Macintosh, it also meant that he had little decision-making power. However, it wouldn’t be Scott that would eventually fire Jobs on the coming years, but a man named John Sculley. Ironically John would be hired, in 1983, by Steve Jobs himself, to run Apple as its CEO, after his amazing job at turning Pepsi into a profitable company. 
            Apple at this time wasn’t doing very well and has already gone through two CEOs, Michael Scott and Mike Markkula, and neither were able to create a follow up computer to the wildly successful Apple II. Jobs was very keen that the future of computing would be based upon graphic user interfaces (GUI), which features a mouse, cursor, and virtual desktop with icons and folders. This led to the creation of Lisa, which had a very high price point of $10,000 and only sold 10,000 computers over a lifespan of two years. Despite the failure on sales of Lisa Steve still believed in GUI and led the effort to develop the Macintosh. To prevent the macintosh from failing on sales as Lisa did Steve wanted the Macintosh to sell at just $2,000 to compete with the PCs of others, like IBM, selling at a price of around $1.600. However, John Sculley disagreed with Jobs and that the Macintosh should sell at $2.500. This led to a disagreement that would take months and even end their friendship. But in the end the Macintosh was put on sale priced at $2.500, after the board of directors agreed to Sculley’s offer. That give Jobs an excuse that if the Macintosh failed, which it eventually happened, it would be is fault because it was priced it too high. 
            All this led to the tension between Jobs and Sculley to reach an all-time high and the board of directors to rethink jobs position in the company, as all his projects were very time consuming and provided zero commercial successful products. And so sculley had to make the So Sculley made the tough decision to reduce Job’s roles and responsibilities within the company. But Jobs himself found out about this plan before he was supposed to. And he used that time to put together a plan of his own. He formed an alliance with other employees and tried organizing at coup to take over the leadership roles at Apple and force the existing members out. But it was too little too late, Sculley caught wind of this effort and called for an emergency board meeting to address the issue. And it was at this meeting when Steve Jobs was told that his day-to-day decision-making power within the company would be removed. And that he’d have his own corner office with the freedom to experiment with emerging technology as he wished, except he wouldn’t be able to lead any projects, and no one would report to him. Jobs didn’t accept this offer, and instead forced the board to vote on who they’d prefer as Apple’s leader: Himself, or Sculley. But this is where Jobs made a fatal mistake. He believed that the board was on his side, so when they unanimously voted in support of Sculley, Jobs was stunned. And he stormed out of the meeting in anger. So that means technically, no one fired Jobs, but he lost so much control of his own company that he preferred to leave and start a new one. And so that’s what he did he started another company called NeXT and one other called PIXAR. And little did he know that NeXT would eventually be how he got back to Apple.
