      <div class="about-container">
        <p>Apple Inc., founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, began as a 
        company focused on creating personal computers. Its first product, the Apple I, was a hand-built computer kit, 
        followed by the revolutionary Apple II, which helped popularize personal computing. In the 1980s, 
        Apple introduced the Macintosh, a groundbreaking computer with a graphical user interface, setting a 
        new industry standard. However, the company faced challenges in the 1990s, struggling with declining sales 
        and leadership issues. In 1997, Steve Jobs returned as CEO, spearheading a period of remarkable innovation with 
        products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which transformed industries and solidified Apple's reputation as a 
        leader in design and technology. Today, Apple is one of the world's most valuable companies, known for its ecosystem 
        of devices and services.</p>
